# resume-builder

Writing resumes is hard, messing with margins in word processors is tedious. I think better in CSS than in Microsoft Word, and I'd rather keep all my data in a pared-down format like YAML. I built this resume builder for myself — but I hope you enjoy using it too!

- Write YAML in provided text editor, see resume update live!
- Print to save a PDF
- View estimated printer margins

The app is a static site built with Ember.js, hosted on GitHub Pages. If you'd like to do more customization, fork this repository and take a look at [`app/templates/components/resume-layout.hbs`](app/templates/components/resume-layout.hbs) or [`app/styles/app.scss`](app/styles/app.scss) to get started.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/)

## Installation

* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* `cd resume-builder`
* `yarn install`

## Running / Development

* `ember serve`
* Visit [http://localhost:4200/resume-builder/](http://localhost:4200/resume-builder/) (note: the trailing slash is important!)

### Building & Deploying

The app is "deployed" by checking in the built Ember assets. GitHub Pages will use Jekyll to serve the `index.html` (generated by Ember CLI) and any assets it requests. There's an Ember CLI Deploy pipeline set up to build assets and move them to the right location.

After making changes to the app, run:

* `ember deploy production`
* Commit changes
* Open pull request or push to `master` branch
